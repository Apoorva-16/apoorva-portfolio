How to preview locally

Open the files in a browser. From the project folder you can run a lightweight static server, for example:

python3 -m http.server 8000

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser and navigate to `index.html`.

Customizing content

Edit `index.html` and `resume.html` to update contact links, LinkedIn URL, or project details. The CSS is simple and easy to change in `styles.css`.
